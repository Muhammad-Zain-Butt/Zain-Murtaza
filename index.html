    <h2>Where I see myself:</h2>
    <p>In ten years, I envision myself at the forefront of technological innovation, leveraging my education and experience to make significant contributions to the field of computer science. With a solid foundation from the University of Education, I anticipate being deeply involved in cutting-edge research and development, perhaps specializing in areas such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, or software engineering. Whether working in academia, industry, or even starting my own tech venture, I see myself leading teams, tackling complex problems, and pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the realm of technology. </p>
